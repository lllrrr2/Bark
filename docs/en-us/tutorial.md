2. Modify the content and request this URL.<br>
You can send a GET or POST request. If the request is successful, you will receive the push notification immediately.

## URL Format
The URL consists of the push key, parameter title, parameter subtitle, and parameter body. There are three combinations:

```
/:key/:body 
/:key/:title/:body 
/:key/:title/:subtitle/:body 
```

## Request Methods
##### GET request parameters are appended to the URL, for example:
```sh
curl https://api.day.app/your_key/body?group=groupName&copy=copyText
```
*When manually appending parameters to the URL, please pay attention to URL encoding issues.*

##### POST request parameters are placed in the request body, for example:
```sh
curl -X POST https://api.day.app/your_key \
     -d'body=body&group=groupName&copy=copyText'
```
##### POST requests support JSON, for example:
```sh
curl -X "POST" "https://api.day.app/your_key" \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \
     -d $'{
  "body": "Test Bark Server",
